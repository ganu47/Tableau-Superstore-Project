# Superstore Sales Dashboard (Tableau) 🛒

An interactive dashboard built using the Tableau platform to analyse sales performance, region‑wise profitability, product trends and key insights from the classic “Sample Superstore” dataset.

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project enabled me to explore sales data from various angles:
- Region‑wise sales & profit visualization
- Top performing products and categories
- Trend analysis over time: monthly/yearly sales growth
- Identifying underperforming segments and opportunities

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Tableau** – For dashboard creation, interactive filters & visual story‑telling
- **Excel / CSV** – Raw dataset handling, preparation and cleaning
- **Data Visualization Best Practices** – Effective colour use, layout design, filter/slicer integration
